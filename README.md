# CompanyBlog
 
This project is deployed in Heroku and can be reached at https://mycompanyblogproject.herokuapp.com/

This project is developed using Flask and sqlite.

This project can be thought of as a Blog created for a company which allows users to register themselves.

Once the user is logged in, the user will be able to view the blog posts that are created already and create his own post, update or delete his own posts later, if needed.

The posts created by a particular user are visible to all the other registered members of the company.

In this project, I have made us of FlaskForms, werkzeug.security (for storing the hashed passord in the database), blue prints to ensure the user is logged in before accessing the blog portal.
